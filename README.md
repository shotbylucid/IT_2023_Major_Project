# Major_Project
This project was orignally meant to be a Slot Machine Gmae based on one of the previous projects I had done but ended up rethinking the project and going for a Payroll System intead.

> I had never acutally made sure the code in it's current state is working but when I did orginally submit the project it was working for a short time but I haven't ever tested it since.

## Main Features
- Local Users (Hashes users passwords and stores them in a local file)
- Template button for certain employees
